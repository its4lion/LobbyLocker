LobbyLocker is a game server region blocker for Windows and Linux. Choose the
regions you want to avoid, apply the changes, and lobbylocker manages its own
operating-system firewall rules.

> [!WARNING]
> LobbyLocker is still in beta. Server addresses can change, Windows builds are
> unsigned, and blocking a shared IP range can affect other applications.

## Features

- Region blocking for Overwatch 2, Deadlock, and Counter-Strike 2
- Custom games, regions, IP addresses, subnets, protocols, and ports
- Installed-game discovery and custom library folders
- Firewall status read directly from the operating system
- Manual ping checks that never change selections or firewall rules
- English and Arabic interfaces with right-to-left support

## Download

Download a versioned build from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/its4lion/LobbyLocker/releases).

| Platform                       | Package                |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Windows 11                     | NSIS `.exe` installer  |
| Ubuntu 24.04 LTS               | `.deb` package         |
| Arch Linux                     | `.pkg.tar.zst` package |
| Other compatible Linux systems | AppImage (best effort) |

Windows SmartScreen may warn because Windows builds are not code-signed. Linux
requires `nftables`, `pkexec`, and a working desktop polkit agent.

Windows installers and AppImages check for signed versioned updates when the app
opens and ask before installing. Ubuntu and Arch packages continue to update
through their package files or package manager.

## How to use

1. Open LobbyLocker and choose a detected game or add a custom game.
2. Select the regions you do **not** want to use.
3. Click **Apply** and approve the operating-system permission prompt.

Rules stay active after LobbyLocker closes. Use **Settings → Reset** to remove
all LobbyLocker rules.

## Important behavior

- **Windows:** rules apply only to the exact game executable you select.
- **Linux:** rules apply system-wide to the selected addresses.
- LobbyLocker changes only its own firewall objects: `LobbyLocker.Managed.v1`
  on Windows and `inet lobbylocker_v1` on Linux.
- LobbyLocker does not modify game files, inject code, launch games, or route
  traffic through another server.
- Ping and connection scans are manual and never alter firewall rules.
- Matchmaking can still choose an unexpected server, especially in a party.
  Use a custom game—not the Overwatch practice range—when testing blocking.
- There are no anti-cheat, matchmaking-region, or ranked-match guarantees.

AppImages do not have an uninstaller. Run **Settings → Reset** before deleting
one. The Windows, Ubuntu, and Arch uninstallers attempt to remove LobbyLocker
rules before removing the application.

## Games and server data

LobbyLocker includes starter data for Overwatch 2, Deadlock, and CS2. Server
lists can be incomplete or outdated, so every game can be edited locally.

Each game is stored as a JSON file:

- Linux: `~/.config/lobbylocker/games/`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\lobbylocker\games\`

Existing game files are never overwritten automatically during an upgrade.
Overwatch cloud ranges are provider-owned ranges, not an official Blizzard
server list. LobbyLocker is not affiliated with Blizzard, Valve, or Google.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem                                 | What to do                                                                       |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A game is missing                       | Use **Scan games**, add its library folder, or choose its executable.            |
| Firewall status cannot be read          | Approve the permission prompt, then click **Retry**.                             |
| A server still connects                 | Check the address list and test in a custom match.                               |
| Another app loses connectivity on Linux | Shared addresses are blocked system-wide; change the selection or use **Reset**. |
| Removing an AppImage                    | Use **Settings → Reset** first.                                                  |

If the UI cannot open, an installed binary can remove owned rules with:

```sh
lobbylocker --reset-firewall
```

## Development

LobbyLocker uses Tauri 2, Rust, Svelte 5, and TypeScript. Development requires
Rust 1.90+, Node.js 22.12+, pnpm 10.17.1, and the
[Tauri prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for your platform.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Quality checks:

```sh
pnpm format:check
pnpm check
pnpm test
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
```
